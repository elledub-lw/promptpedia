          Promptpedia was born from a simple frustration: great AI prompts are
          hard to keep track of. You craft the perfect prompt, get amazing
          results, and then... you can't find it two weeks later. It's buried in
          a chat history, lost in a notes app, or saved in a file you forgot
          about.
        </p>

          style="color: var(--color-text-secondary);"

          We built Promptpedia to solve this. It's a personal prompt library
          with version control baked in. Every prompt you save has a full
          history — you can see how it evolved, what changes improved results,
          and revert to earlier versions when needed. Think of it as Git for
          your AI prompts.

          Promptpedia is intentionally simple. It's a static site with no
          server, no database, and no tracking. Your prompts live in your
          repository, deployed to your infrastructure. You own everything. No
          surprise dependencies, no data collection, no magic — just clean code
          you can understand and control.
