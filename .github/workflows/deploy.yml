# deploy.yml
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Triggers on every push to the "main" branch
# 2. Installs dependencies and builds the Astro site
# 3. Uploads the built files to GitHub Pages
#
# To enable this:
# 1. Go to your repo Settings → Pages
# 2. Set "Source" to "GitHub Actions"
